A command palette to search in your Chrome bookmarks, made with [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

You can customize :
- Hotkey (`Ctrl + Space` by default)
- Toggle _search in folder name_
- Bookmarks profiles paths

The script contains some personal customization (dealing with display prefixes and profiles priority), feel free to overwrite it to suite your needs.  
Thanks to [JXON_ahk2](https://github.com/TheArkive/JXON_ahk2/) for JSON parsing.

## Scope
Although I will consider suggestions and PRs, I made this app to suit my needs in terms of features and accessibility.
